# cse341-Resort-Inn

Here are my contributions to the project:

1. Setting up authentication – I implemented the login and logout functionality to ensure secure user sessions.
2. Writing API documentation – I created clear and detailed API documentation using Swagger to help developers understand and utilize the API endpoints.
3. Error handling and debugging – I enhanced error messages to make debugging easier, improving the overall reliability of the application.
